## Purpose

The topic of our project is an application that tracks your loved one's special dates and their wish lists. We have also added gift exchange functionality to our application. Our application will send emails reminding the user of their loved one's special dates and send emails informing users who they are paired with for the gift exchange and some suggestions of what to get them as a gift.
